This contains the new June 2020 A4 impulse responses that were rederived from the
2019 impulse response measurements (explained below). This was performed independently
by both Peter and Cosmin - this directory contains Peter's final responses. See the
#antenna-theory channel on the ANITA slack for *a lot* more information.

For legacy reasons, the trigger path responses are named `trigconfig*.imp` where
the mapping from {A,B,C...} to frequency specifications is not easily accesible.
The mapping is reproduced here:

A: 260_0_0
B: 260_375_0
C: 260_0_460
G: 260_385_0
K: 0_0_0
O: 260_365_0
P: 260_375_460

These impulse responses were derived from new ANITA data taken in the
UH anechoic chamber, summer 2019, using the UCLA Electrometrics  dual-ridge horn.
the UCLA horn was separately calibrated for impulse response 
using a pair of TEM horns that were calibrated against each other. The UCLA response was 
deconvolved from UCLA->TEMhorn data using both CLEAN and a Wiener deconvolution method,
and the two were tested for best fidelity by re-convolving with the original data.
In this case, CLEAN gave higher fidelity and was used for the UCLA horn impulse function.

One channel, 07BV was not functional and thus we copy the 07BH data to 07BV as a proxy.

A single Seavey ANITA-4 horn and preamp were used for these data, so no
actual antenna or preamp differences are captured here. The horn and preamp
were chosen as representative of the average, neither were outliers.

The data is sampled at 10 Gs/s, and times are given in ns. The data are in
two columns, time and data, space-separated. The peak of the waveform
in each case occurs at about 5 ns into the waveform, and it is zero padded
to 1024 samples total (102.4 ns), as in the case of the original impulse responses.
